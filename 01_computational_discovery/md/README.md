# Molecular Dynamics

This folder tracks GROMACS work for the active 8-candidate LiSPER library after ESMFold and CHARMM-GUI preparation.

## Current State

The active MD workflow now uses the final 8-candidate names. All eight ESMFold structures are ready. All LiCl and NaCl CHARMM-GUI systems are GROMACS-ready. LiCl and NaCl setup are complete for all eight candidates. LiCl and NaCl 20 ns production plus clustering are running across two AutoDL workers without duplicate candidate-condition-stage jobs. Umbrella sampling is active condition-by-condition for clustered representatives.

Latest production/umbrella snapshot: `2026-06-25 17:20 CST`.

| Condition | Folder | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| LiCl | `li_cl/` | Replacement Worker A active at 10/18 safe mdrun threads after stopping old non-v2 windows; 2/8 production jobs active plus audited v2 `LiDS-1` LiCl pull and `LiDA-1` LiCl v2 window equilibration; 6/8 representatives ready |
| NaCl | `na_cl/` | Worker B active at 4/12 safe mdrun threads with one production job plus audited v2 `LiDS-1` and `LiDA-1` NaCl pulls; future v2 window concurrency capped to stay within quota; 5/8 representatives ready |
| Umbrella | `remote_runs_umbrella_sampling_status.md` | Old-parameter umbrella compute stopped/guarded; audited binding-site v2 pulls active for paired `LiDS-1` and `LiDA-1` LiCl/NaCl; PMF/Delta G remains preliminary until v2 WHAM/bootstrap/time-slice QC passes |

Remote 8-candidate workspaces were initialized on AutoDL:

| Condition | Remote workspace |
|---|---|
| LiCl | `/root/LiSPER_remote/LiSPER_8cand_LiCl` |
| NaCl setup | `/root/LiSPER_remote/LiSPER_8cand_NaCl` |
| NaCl production | `/root/LiSPER_remote/LiSPER_8cand_NaCl_prod_worker` |
| NaCl backfill | `/root/LiSPER_remote/LiSPER_8cand_NaCl_overflow_workerA` |

## What Belongs Here

| Sub-area | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `remote_orchestration/` | Scripts and sync maps for the 8-candidate remote workflow |
| `li_cl/remote_runs/` | LiCl launch/status logs for the 8-candidate workflow |
| `li_cl/remote_results/` | Synced LiCl outputs for the 8-candidate workflow |
| `na_cl/remote_runs/` | NaCl launch/status logs for the 8-candidate workflow |
| `na_cl/remote_results/` | Synced NaCl outputs for the 8-candidate workflow |

Do not launch new GROMACS work for a candidate until that candidate has final-name ESMFold and matched CHARMM-GUI inputs ready.
