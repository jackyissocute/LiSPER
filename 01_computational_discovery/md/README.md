# Molecular Dynamics

This folder tracks GROMACS work for the active 8-candidate LiSPER library after ESMFold and CHARMM-GUI preparation.

## Current State

The active MD workflow now uses the final 8-candidate names. All eight ESMFold structures are ready. All LiCl and NaCl CHARMM-GUI systems are GROMACS-ready. LiCl and NaCl setup are complete for all eight candidates. LiCl 20 ns production plus clustering is running on the original worker. The two formerly queued NaCl jobs have been backfilled to the original worker after LiDA-1 LiCl completed production and clustering.

Latest production snapshot: `2026-06-20 23:41 CST`.

| Condition | Folder | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| LiCl | `li_cl/` | 7/8 production jobs active; `6.94-16.38 ns / 20 ns`; `LiDA-1` produced and clustered; top cluster `17.64%` |
| NaCl | `na_cl/` | 8/8 production jobs active across both workers; Worker B active jobs `4.47-15.93 ns / 20 ns`; Worker A backfill jobs `0.57-0.76 ns / 20 ns` |

Remote 8-candidate workspaces were initialized on AutoDL:

| Condition | Remote workspace |
|---|---|
| LiCl | `/root/LiSPER_remote/LiSPER_8cand_LiCl` |
| NaCl setup | `/root/LiSPER_remote/LiSPER_8cand_NaCl` |
| NaCl production | `/root/LiSPER_remote/LiSPER_8cand_NaCl_prod_worker` |
| NaCl backfill | `/root/LiSPER_remote/LiSPER_8cand_NaCl_overflow_workerA` |

## What Belongs Here

| Sub-area | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `remote_orchestration/` | Scripts and sync maps for the 8-candidate remote workflow |
| `li_cl/remote_runs/` | LiCl launch/status logs for the 8-candidate workflow |
| `li_cl/remote_results/` | Synced LiCl outputs for the 8-candidate workflow |
| `na_cl/remote_runs/` | NaCl launch/status logs for the 8-candidate workflow |
| `na_cl/remote_results/` | Synced NaCl outputs for the 8-candidate workflow |

Do not launch new GROMACS work for a candidate until that candidate has final-name ESMFold and matched CHARMM-GUI inputs ready.
